This project is my final project for the Harvard CS50 course. 

In this project, I've prepared a web application that is oriented towards powerlifting. Specifically, using a html/css/javascript user interface, users can log in, view personal powerlifting meet results, view any user powerlifting meet results, register for a powerlifting event, and update personal information such as password, email, phone number, and personal best lifting records.
