0.  An artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.
1.  "returns  resource usage measures for RUSAGE_SELF, RUSAGE_CHILDREN, RUSAGE_THREAD"
2.  16
3.  We pass the reference vice the value so we actually change the local copy, not a remote copy.
4.  Let's look at the for loop: for (int c = fgetc(fp); c != EOF; c = fgetc(fp))
    This loop establishes an int, c, which initially reads the first character from the file,
    and is 'incremented' by subsequently reading the next character in the file after each
    loop iteration. We then check that character for being a valid character, number, etc., and
    store it in an array as appropriate. If the word is complete, we null terminate it and check
    it via the user-defined 'check' function.
5.  fgetc allows us to read character-by-character, while fscanf may return a longer-than-
    expected word that we cannot buffer and overflow some pre-defined space.
6.  The const declaration lets the compiler know that those parameters will not be changed,
    nor should they, during the execution of that function.
